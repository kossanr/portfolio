      Coding, drawing, road trips, and hearty conversations are just a few
      things that make me excited to wake up early or stay up late. So far, my
      favorite things about being a developer are the daily learning
      opportunities, being creative, challenging myself, the joyous moment after
      solving a problem, and making things look pretty (after making them
      functional, obviously).
