      <p class="bio">
        Coding, drawing, road trips, and hearty conversations are just a few
        things that make me excited to wake up early or stay up late. I look
        forward to working alongside, collaborating, and learning with a team of
        programmers. My favorite things about being a developer are the daily
        learning opportunities, being creative, challenging myself, the joyous
        moment after solving a problem, and making things look pretty (after
        making them functional, obviously).
